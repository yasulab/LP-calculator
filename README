This program is a calculator which can run along this specification below.

1. can use operands: +, -, *, /, %
2. can use Gauss's integer using branckets
3. can change priority of operation using parenthsis
4. can assign value to a valuable structured by alphabets 


The specification is implemented by this syntax rule below.

expression = ['-'] term {('+'|'-') term }
term = primary {('*'|'/'|'%') primary }
primary = character | figure | '(' expression ')' | '[' expression ']'
character = ID | ID '=' expression
figure = {number} ['.' {number}]
number = 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
ID = a|b|...|y|z|A|B|...|Y|Z
